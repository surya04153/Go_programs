	In a world of semicolons, wide and deep,
Where threads and locks put code to sleep,
Came Go, a language light and swift,
To give the coder’s world a lift.

No more waits for builds so slow,
Concurrency flows, like rivers in Go.
With goroutines dancing, light as air,
Parallel tasks get done with care.

No classes, no inheritance tree,
Just structs and interfaces, simple and free.
The garbage collector sweeps with grace,
While your code speeds on, a steady pace.

Error handling, though plain and bare,
Ensures your programs handle with care.
A compiled friend, it runs so fast,
Through problems large, it’ll always last.

So here’s to Go, the language bright,
That turns our code from day to night.
In simplicity, it finds its might,
With Go, the future shines so light.
